<h2>In-game Events</h2>
<p>Here we list some of the events that require some attention to get better rewards and/or progress faster:</p>

          <li>Find a partner with similar Formation 1 (F1) Combat Power.</li>
          <li>Move your town to the meetup location (defined by your leaders).</li>
          <li>Before the event starts, exchange F1s with your partner.</li>
          <li>Recall, replanish and send back your troops whenever necessary.</li>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>
                Before the event, look up which difficulty your event will be and find a partner that have
                the same difficulty level and approximately the same Combat Power (CB) as your's Formation 1 (F1).<br>
                Before it starts, you and your partner will send each other's F1 as reinforcement.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the event, all the clan members will be attacked 20 times (waves) of Walkers, with
                each wave being stronger than the last one, with 2 minutes between the attacks.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                Stay online during the event and right after a wave hits, ponder if your troops can handle the next
                attack.
                If you think that you need to restock your troops, recall them, replenish your troops and send it back
                as
                soon as possible. Because of that, it is recommended that you and your partner have your towns close
                to each other
                (your leaders will set up meeting points so everyone can get together and send their spare troops to
                whoever needs it).

              <p>
                <b>Solo:</b><br>
                Here, you will have to defeat 20 enemies, which gets stronger each level.<br>
                Every 5 levels, there is a kind of mini-boss. So, at levels 5, 10, 15 and
                20 is recommended to ask for help and/or rallying.<br>
                <strong>Remind that you can and should select your event difficulty before starting. </strong>
                After defeating all 20 levels of a given difficulty, it will pre-select
                a higher tier in the next event.<br>
                The higher the difficulty, the better are the rewards.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                <b>Clan Boss:</b><br>
                Here, your leaders will select a difficulty and schedule for the Whisperers Boss.
                On the determined date, the boss will be open for attacks. It will stay still for
                up to 12 hours or until he is defeated.<br>
                You have up to 10 attacks: 5 free attacks and another 5 for 100 rubies each attack.<br>
                You should go for 10 attacks whenever possible.<br>
                <strong>Sharpshooters gets more kills/points against this boss.</strong>

                In the first part of the event, the leaders might change constantly the markers
                placed on the map, as the main goal is to reach and kill the boss, it will trace
                the fastest path to it.

                Please, follow their orders. It will make the event progress faster

                It's important to note that some missions asks for a certain number of attacks
