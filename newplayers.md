              It is possible to go solo and play like an idle farming game. However, being solo in a PVP-enabled game
              will only invite the other players to use you to farm points and hinder your growth.<br>
              The main focus of the game is in fact Cooperation. In a Clan you will have access to the full game, such
              as events, speed ups help, town reinforcements, resource donations, rally attacks and much more.

        The game is all about Communication. At least, pay attention to the Clan Event page, pinned messages in the
        Clan Chat and maybe Personal Messages from your leaders.

              Being part of a clan, communidation is the key to a safe and fast growth.<br>
              Communication here doesn't necessarily mean to actively talk to other people, however
              it is highly encouraged to do so. Communication here means following the clan's
              announcements, reading the clan's pinned messages and letters and, occasionally,
              replaying to private messages.

          <div class="accordion-collapse details collapse" id="being-active">
            <div class="accordion-body">
              To be Active means that you log in at least once every two day. Though,
              to grow in a reasonable pace, it is recommended to play it at least
              twice a day. But, the more the better.<br>
              Also, many clans won't keep inactive players and will kick them out, making
              them unable to have access to many rewards and benefits that a clan can provide them.
