<h2>New Players' Must Know</h2>
<p>Key points:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Team Play:</dt>
    <dd>
        It is possible to go solo and play like an idle farming game. However, being solo in a PVP-enabled game will only invite 
        the other players to use you to farm points and hinder your growth.<br>
        The main focus of the game is in fact Cooperation. In a Clan you will have access to the full game, such as events, speed 
        ups help, town reinforcements, resource donations, rally attacks and much more.
    </dd>
    <dt>Communication:</dt>
    <dd>
        Being part of a clan, communidation is the key to a safe and fast growth.<br>
        Communication here doesn't necessarily mean to actively talk to other people, however it is highly encouraged to do so. 
        Communication here means following the clan's announcements, reading the clan's pinned messages and letters and, occasionally,
        replaying to private messages.
    </dd>
    <dt>Being Active</dt>
    <dd>To be Active means that you log in at least once every two day. Though, it is recommended to play it at least twice a day.</dd>
